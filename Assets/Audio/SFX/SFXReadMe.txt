Here is a description of / guideline on how to use each SFX in the Audio Module: (this list will be updated periodically)

NOTE: As SFX creator, I am simply creating sounds as loud as possible without clipping, as Unity’s volume function is shit. Therefore, it will be up to the dev implementing sounds to test for volume as new sounds are put in.

In the order they appear (to me at least):

-Axe Pickup
When you pick up the axe, at any point

-HealthPack Pickup
When you pick up (walk over) any health packs

-Trinket Pickup
When you pick up any trinket

-Footsteps
This is a loop of grass footsteps. Only to be used if we do it that way.

-Light Footsteps
Same ^. Ed made two things and I don’t delete

-Grass Footsteps 1 - Grass Footsteps 2
If we go the direction we want to, these are the 7 individual grass footsteps to be played RANDOMLY as the player walks. Needs to be matched up with walk animation timing.
